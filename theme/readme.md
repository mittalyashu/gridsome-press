# Theme

> All options listed on this page apply to the default theme only. If you are using a custom theme, the options may be different.

## Homepage

The default theme provides a homepage layout (which is used on the homepage of this very website). To use it, specify home: true plus some other metadata in your root README.md's YAML front matter. This is the actual data used on this site:

Any additional content after the YAML front matter will be parsed as normal markdown and rendered after the features section.

If you want to use a completely custom homepage layout, you can also use a Custom Layout.

## Navbar

The Navbar may contain your page title, Search Box, Navbar Links, Languages and Repository Link, all of them depends on your configuration.
